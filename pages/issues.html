    <!-- NATIONAL DEBT -->
    <section class="issue-section" id="national-debt">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="issue-content">
          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i> The National Debt</h2>

          <div class="issue-highlight">
            <h3>My Top Priority</h3>
            <p>The nation's deficit is one of my greatest concerns for our country's future and the future of our children. If we truly care about our children's future, we must begin taking responsible, meaningful steps to address our nation's debt.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The primary driver of this problem is excessive federal spending—particularly in healthcare—though other spending categories are also growing far too quickly. Today, the national debt stands at roughly <strong>125 percent of gross domestic product</strong>, the highest level since the all-out wartime emergency of World War II. Many economists suggest a more sustainable ratio would be closer to 50 percent.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the COVID years of 2020 and 2021, the federal deficit surged to $3.1 trillion and $2.7 trillion, respectively. In the years since, deficits have remained historically high, averaging between approximately $1.3 and $1.8 trillion annually, with total federal spending ranging from about $6.2 to $6.7 trillion per year. <strong>If we remain on this trajectory, our children could soon be paying 30 to 40 cents of every tax dollar just to cover interest on the debt.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>My Solution</h3>
          <p>
            In my view, the solution is straightforward, though not easy: <strong>reduce spending and adjust taxes to an optimal and responsible level</strong>. Overall, the current tax structure represents a reasonably fair distribution of the burden, but loopholes exist that allow certain individuals to avoid paying their fair share at the expense of everyone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            While it is true that many wealthy Americans reinvest capital into ventures that create jobs and economic value, I would not rule out targeted, justified tax increases where appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Healthcare spending remains the most difficult challenge, and there are no simple solutions. However, requiring Congress to pass a <strong>truly balanced budget—without exceptions</strong>—would force federal agencies to make necessary and difficult decisions. While some programs would be affected, I believe that responsible reductions can be made without allowing Americans to go hungry or suffer undue medical hardship.
          </p>

          <p>
            The alternative—continuing to do nothing—would allow the debt to grow unchecked, placing an even greater burden on future generations.

    <!-- IMMIGRATION -->

      <div class="container">
        <div class="issue-content">
          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i> Border Security & Immigration</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>I believe in legal immigration.</strong> To prevent the continued flow of illegal immigration, I support the current administration's approach, including stronger border enforcement, restrictions on asylum abuse, targeted deportations, and other constructive measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additional improvements could include expanding physical barriers in high-traffic areas, increased use of surveillance technology, and ensuring adequate staffing for border agents.
          </p>

          <h3>Benefits Policy</h3>
          <p>
            While no one should be allowed to go hungry or suffer unnecessary medical hardship, <strong>government benefits for undocumented immigrants should be limited</strong>. Access to public benefits can serve as a strong incentive for illegal immigration and contributes to long-term fiscal strain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, I believe we should eliminate the hypocrisy in our current laws that allow the employment of undocumented immigrants through various loopholes, as this only adds to confusion and tension surrounding immigration enforcement.
          </p>

          <h3>Pro-Legal Immigration</h3>
          <p>
            The United States clearly benefits from legal immigration. <strong>When individuals are properly vetted and come to this country to work, contribute, and follow the law, it is a win-win for both immigrants and the nation as a whole.</strong>
          </p>

        <div class="issue-content">
          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> Russia, Ukraine & Foreign Policy</h2>

          <p>
            <em>My son-in-law is in the Army and currently stationed in Poland, which makes this conflict personal for me. One of my nephews is serving in the Navy, and one of my sons served six years as an infantry Marine and is now a Veteran. I understand what it means to view world events through the lens of having loved ones on or near the front lines.</em>
          </p>

          <h3>My Position</h3>
          <p>
            Based on my current understanding, <strong>I support honoring our commitments to NATO</strong> by guaranteeing the protection of NATO member states. I also support establishing and enforcing firm military boundaries along existing lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            As long as the Ukrainian people have the will to fight, I support providing Ukraine with the munitions and supplies necessary to help them hold those lines. <strong>I do not support direct involvement of U.S. ground troops</strong> in this conflict unless there is a compelling and credible case that direct U.S. military involvement could bring the war to a swift conclusion with minimal casualties.
          </p>

          <p>
            In light of recent corruption allegations involving Ukrainian military officials, comprehensive auditing and oversight of military funding should also be conducted.
          </p>

          <h3>Long-Term Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            I strongly support a long-term strategy aimed at preventing further Russian aggression. This includes <strong>taking deliberate action to drive down global oil prices in order to weaken Russia's economy</strong>. With effective leadership, Venezuela could reclaim its position as an economically successful nation. The full return of Venezuelan oil to global markets could significantly reduce oil prices and further undermine Russia's primary source of revenue.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would also strongly support efforts to limit or discourage the purchase of Russian crude by China and India. This situation is both prolonged and dangerous, with the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict. The risks and benefits of every course of action must be carefully weighed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>In my view, a long-term economic strategy offers the safest and most effective path forward.</strong> That said, if credible intelligence were to emerge suggesting that an alternative approach would be more effective, I would remain open to reconsidering my position.
          </p>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">A person <strong>may not</strong> knowingly perform, induce, or attempt an abortion</li>

            I support mandatory vaccinations for diseases that provide the greatest public health benefit and have been proven safe, such as <strong>measles, polio, pertussis, rubella, and diphtheria</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Decisions regarding other vaccinations should remain at the parents' discretion. <strong>I support parents' right to exempt their children from vaccinations under current Texas law.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in the event of an outbreak of a specific disease in a particular area, I would support requiring the relevant vaccination or, alternatively, quarantining unvaccinated children to prevent further spread.

          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> Tariffs & Trade</h2>

          <p>
            The stated intent of the tariffs is to increase manufacturing within the United States which could be beneficial. When a product is manufactured domestically and sold in the U.S. versus purchasing from an international supplier, there is a clear competitive advantage to the U.S. supplier.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, based on practical experience, <strong>tariffs can also hinder U.S. manufacturing</strong>. In some cases, an item can be purchased from a foreign supplier from another foreign supplier to avoid paying U.S. tariffs, thus hurting a U.S. manufacturer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tariff revenue collected in 2025 was approximately $195 billion. It should be noted that the administration has allocated roughly $12 billion to farmers to offset the effects of tariffs on agricultural products.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I believe this should be monitored for effectiveness and proper action taken in the future.</strong>

            Overall, I would leave it up to someone more knowledgeable about the education system than I. I think the overall allocation of funds to poorer school districts is a benefit of the Department of Education, but <strong>I oppose mandates contrary to the values of the majority of the local community</strong>.
